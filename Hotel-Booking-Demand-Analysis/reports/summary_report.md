# 📊 Summary Report: Hotel Booking Demand Analysis

## 🧾 Project Overview

This project conducts an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of hotel booking data collected from **City** and **Resort** hotels. The primary goal is to uncover insights about customer behavior, booking trends, cancellation patterns, and seasonal effects, which can help hotel managers and data-driven teams make better business decisions.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Notebook:** Jupyter
- **Visualization:** Line plots, bar charts, heatmaps, boxplots
- **Others:** CSV data parsing, date formatting, correlation analysis

---

## 🔍 Key Questions Explored

1. What is the distribution of bookings between City and Resort hotels?
2. How do cancellations vary across months and customer segments?
3. What lead time is associated with cancellations?
4. Which months and countries have the highest booking volumes?
5. Are there any seasonal trends in bookings?
6. How do different customer types (e.g. transient, group) behave?

## 📈 Major Insights

- **Hotel Type:** City hotels have more bookings but also show a higher cancellation rate than Resort hotels.
- **Seasonality:** Resort hotel bookings peak during the summer (June–August), while City hotels have a more consistent flow year-round.
- **Cancellations:** Longer lead times are strongly associated with cancellations.
- **Customer Segments:** Most bookings come from individual (transient) customers.
- **Top Countries:** Portugal is the largest contributor to hotel bookings, followed by the UK, France, and Spain.
- **Special Requests & Stays:** Guests with more special requests and longer stays are less likely to cancel.

## 🛠 Recommendations

- **Cancellation Prediction:** A machine learning model can be built to predict the likelihood of cancellations using features like lead time, deposit type, and booking changes.
- **Marketing Strategy:** Focus promotions on months with low occupancy and countries with fewer bookings.
- **Customer Targeting:** Improve retention among customers with no special requests or high lead time bookings, as they are more likely to cancel.
